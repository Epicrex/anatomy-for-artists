# Hi
I'm working on completely overhauling the anatomy for artists handbook, to make it more practical to use with more relevant information for character artists, and be in line with my other handbook https://sidney-eliot.github.io/3d-artists-handbook. This might take some time though as I'm working on some other projects at the moment, so for the time being the GitHub wiki version is still up and available https://github.com/Epicrex/AnatomyForArtists/wiki.
