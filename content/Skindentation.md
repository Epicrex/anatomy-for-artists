## What is Skindentation
**Skindentation** refers to the temporary depression of skin caused by pressure of a clothing piece or other object. This in return results in bulging of the skin around the indentation. The cause is mostly due to an elastic or tied string wrapping around a leg, arm or belly. Examples of clothing that can cause **skindentation** include:
- Thigh highs
- Elbow gloves
- Tall boots
- Any kind of bands/ straps
- Tight clothing in general

It can also occur from the pressure of a hand or object pushing into the skin, as nicely seen in the Greek statue ["The Rape of Proserpina"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rape_of_Proserpina).

## Where does Skindentation Occur
**Skindentation** can occur on any skin-covered area of the body, but some factors can accentuate its depth and visibility or lessen its occurrence. Areas with [[Skeleton#Bony Landmarks|bones close to the surface]], such as:
- Hands
- Fingers
- Feet
- Front of the lower leg (due to the [[Skeleton#Leg Bones|tibia]] bone)
- Neck
- Upper torso (due to the [[Skeleton#Torso Bones|rib cage]])
... tend to exhibit little to no **skinindentation**.

Conversely, areas with deeper bones, such as the thighs, belly and upper arms, are more prone to **skindentation**. The amount of [[Fat Regions|body fat]] also plays a big role; the more [[Fat Regions|fat]] a person has, the more **skindentation** is possible. This is why thighs are the most common area for **skindentation** to occur at, as they have deep bones and a large amount of [[Fat Regions|fat]].
