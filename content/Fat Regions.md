## Properly Making Use of Fat Regions
Clothing, rope/ chains and other things that interact with the body will act differently when touching muscly, bony or normal areas vs areas rich in fat.

More on that in the [[skindentation]] section.

## About the Fat Regions
The location and depth of fat regions are quite different between the male and female body. Generally people with more muscles will have less fat, however even strong females will still have a lot of fat comparatively to males who can almost entirely burn their fat. The main reason for this is that the female body tries to prepare for child bearing. For reference, according to [the American Council on Exercise](https://www.acefitness.org/education-and-resources/lifestyle/tools-calculators/percent-body-fat-calculator/), to function normally females need at least 10% body fat, whereas males only need 2%. This required amount of fat is also referred to as essential fat. 

On average, **female bodies** have is **21%-32% fat** [[1](https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/what-is-body-composition)] while male bodies have 8%-19% fat on average, but that can vastly differ depending on the person.

There are two types of fat regions, **[subcutaneous fat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue)** and **visceral fat**. Of which only **subcutaneous fat** is of importance for artists, this type of fat region is located just beneath the skin and sits on the muscles. **visceral fat** regions surround internal organs and are thus not important.

_Also note that currently only female fat regions are covered here, male fat regions are quite different._

_[[Wkipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast)]_

Breast fat also known as mammary fat is the fat region that differs the most between female bodies. The breasts lay on top of the [[Upper Body Muscles#Pectoralis Mayor|pectoralis mayor]] muscle and are visibly "one" with them. Although breasts aren't fully made of fat, for an artist one can think of them as a 100% fat tissue.

The **abdominal fat pad** starts under the belly button/ the lowest section of six-pack. It's quite visible from the side view.

## Love Handles (Flank Fat Pad)

![[Pasted image 20230710171329.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230710171336.png]]

The **flank fat pad** also known as **love handles**, gives the illusion of higher hips because the waistline starts earlier. This fat pad also reaches more to the front than the **lateral gluteal fat pad** below it.

The **pubic fat pad** also knows as **mons pubis** is the main cause for the camel toe/ pudental cleft that can sometimes be seen through females undergarments.

## Knee Fat Region

![[Pasted image 20230710175805.png]]

_Wikipedia: [[Infrapatellar fat pad]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrapatellar_fat_pad)_

The knees have fat located on the front and back side. 

On the front side of the knee, there are:
- **Lower anterior thigh fat pad**
- **Infrapatellar fat pad**

On the back side of the knee, there is:
- **Popliteal fat pad**

The **lower anterior thigh fat pad** also known as **suprapatellar fat pad** is located above the [[Skeleton#Leg Bones|patella]] (kneecap).

The **infrapatellar fat pad** also known as **hoffa's fat pad** is located on the left and right side below the [[Skeleton#Leg Bones|patella]] (kneecap). It's a small pocket of fat situated between the [[Skeleton#Leg Bones|femur]] (thigh bone) and the [[Leg Muscles#Quadriceps femrois|quadriceps]] tendon, which covers the front of the knee.

The **popliteal fat pad** is located behind the knee and nicely fits between the [[Leg Muscles#Hamstrings|semitendinosus]] and [[Leg Muscles#Hamstrings||biceps femrois]] muscles.
